Below is the suggested instructions for contributors

CODE:
1: make your code readable for other contributors
2: add comments to your code
3: all code will be python until further notice
4: avoid any profanity with code or comments

FILES:
1: always commit before testing install.pt (as it deletes the folder)
2: make sure explain.py can run independtly (so it can be the only script for the actual command)
3: for any new feature, put documentation in README.md

ISSUES:
1: if you find a bug in the code that you can't fix, report it as an issue on github
